# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The F1 Race Prediction System is a machine learning application that predicts Formula 1 race finishing positions based on historical data, qualifying results, driver performance, and track characteristics. The system will collect data from multiple sources, engineer relevant features, train predictive models, and provide an interactive web interface for users to generate race predictions.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a Formula 1 fan, I want to input race parameters (track, grid positions, drivers, weather) and receive predicted finishing positions, so that I can make informed predictions about race outcomes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user selects a track, grid positions, drivers, and weather conditions THEN the system SHALL generate predicted finishing positions for all drivers
2. WHEN predictions are generated THEN the system SHALL display confidence scores and probability distributions for each position
3. WHEN predictions are complete THEN the system SHALL provide visualizations showing predicted vs historical performance
4. IF insufficient data is available for a driver or track THEN the system SHALL notify the user and provide alternative predictions based on available data

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a data analyst, I want the system to collect and process historical F1 data from multiple sources, so that the prediction models have comprehensive training data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the data collection process runs THEN the system SHALL retrieve race results, grid positions, lap times, and driver statistics from the Ergast API
2. WHEN collecting telemetry data THEN the system SHALL integrate FastF1 data including weather conditions and qualifying times
3. WHEN processing raw data THEN the system SHALL clean, validate, and normalize all collected information
4. WHEN data collection is complete THEN the system SHALL store the processed data in a structured format for model training
5. IF API endpoints are unavailable THEN the system SHALL log errors and continue with available data sources

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a machine learning engineer, I want the system to engineer relevant features from raw F1 data, so that the prediction models can identify meaningful patterns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN feature engineering runs THEN the system SHALL calculate rolling averages for driver form over the last 5 races
2. WHEN processing driver data THEN the system SHALL create features for constructor performance and track-specific behavior
3. WHEN handling categorical data THEN the system SHALL properly encode variables using appropriate techniques (OneHot, LabelEncoder)
4. WHEN missing data is encountered THEN the system SHALL apply appropriate imputation strategies
5. WHEN features are complete THEN the system SHALL normalize numerical features for model compatibility

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a system user, I want the prediction models to be accurate and reliable, so that I can trust the race outcome predictions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN training models THEN the system SHALL implement multiple algorithms including Random Forest, XGBoost, and LightGBM
2. WHEN evaluating model performance THEN the system SHALL use appropriate metrics including Spearman rank correlation and mean absolute error
3. WHEN validating models THEN the system SHALL perform cross-validation by track and date to ensure generalization
4. WHEN models are trained THEN the system SHALL achieve accuracy targets for Top 3 and Top 5 position predictions
5. IF model performance is below acceptable thresholds THEN the system SHALL retrain with adjusted parameters

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As an end user, I want an intuitive web interface to interact with the prediction system, so that I can easily generate and view race predictions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing the web application THEN the system SHALL provide input forms for track selection, grid positions, drivers, and weather conditions
2. WHEN predictions are generated THEN the system SHALL display results in clear, interactive charts and tables
3. WHEN viewing results THEN the system SHALL provide insights such as "most likely to overtake" and position change probabilities
4. WHEN using the interface THEN the system SHALL support file uploads for batch predictions via CSV
5. IF the system is processing predictions THEN the system SHALL show loading indicators and progress updates

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the application to be deployable and maintainable, so that it can be reliably hosted and updated.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deploying the application THEN the system SHALL be containerized using Docker for consistent deployment
2. WHEN the application runs THEN the system SHALL be compatible with cloud platforms including Streamlit Cloud and Hugging Face Spaces
3. WHEN documentation is needed THEN the system SHALL include comprehensive README files with usage guides and screenshots
4. WHEN monitoring the system THEN the system SHALL provide logging and error tracking capabilities
5. IF system updates are required THEN the system SHALL support version management and rollback procedures
